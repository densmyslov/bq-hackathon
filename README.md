## Introduction
This project was developed for a Kaggle hackathon focused on using BigQuery AI to make sense of unstructured and mixed-format data (e.g., PDFs, logs, recordings). The challenge is to show how AI can extend SQL to handle messy real-world datasets, going beyond rows and columns to deliver insights through classification, summarization, semantic search, forecasting, or multimodal analysis.
